- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6.x or later)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (v4.x or later)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, for containerization)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alx-backend.git
    cd alx-backend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables. Refer to `.env.example` for the required variables.

4. **Run the database**:
    Ensure MongoDB is running. If using Docker:
